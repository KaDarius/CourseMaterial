We're going to go over the fundamentals of programming. Let's go over all the basics you'll need to get started.

## Documentation

As we go into details of any programming language, you'll find that documentation is your best friend for learning and improving your language skill set:

### C# Documentation

* [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)

### Java Documentation

* [Oracle Docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/)

## Source Code Comments

A comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. Anything within comments will be ignored by a compiler and are just there to help us programmers understand the code better.

You'll use comments for documentation and explanation of your code. Anytime you see comments, just know it's there for clarity.

### C# & Java Comments

* A single line comment is prepended with: `//`
* A multi-line comment is surrounded with: `/* */`

```cs
/* Example multi-line
 * comment
 */

// Example single line comment
```

## Output

When working with programming languages, at times you'll want to output something for your user or yourself. Also, at times, you'll want to read user input. In most languages, this is made available. Don't worry if this doesn't make total sense yet. We'll get there.

### C# Output

```cs
// Write a message to the console
Console.WriteLine("Message to write out");
```
