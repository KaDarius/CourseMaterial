# Java Classes

A class is a construct that enables the creation of custom types by grouping together variables of other types, as well as custom methods and/or events. A class is like a blueprint or a cookie cutter. It defines the data and behavior of a type.

## Classes

Like variables and methods, classes have a few basic parts:

* Modifiers: an optional list of keywords that give certain qualities to the class
* Keyword `class`: required to define a class
* Name: a descriptive class name
* Scope: the scope of the class definition
  * Variables: class or instance variables associated with the class
  * Methods: class or instance methods associated with the class
